A drag and drop demo that resembles card drag and drop in Trello in just a few lines of code.

This is descended from [this blog post by Bruce Hubbard at Differential](http://differential.com/blog/sortable-lists-in-meteor-using-jquery-ui) which itself is based on the [original demo by Avital Oliver](https://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/09/13/previewing-meteors-new-rendering-engine-reactive-sortable-lists).

The ranking mechanism is not robust for heavy use (what if you drag elements to the top of the list over and over?). For an improved version of the same concept, [see this example](https://github.com/stubailo/baobab/blob/master/packages/nodes/nodes.js).
